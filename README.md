# Xorro

# Usage

```
xorro --help
xorro examples/test.lp
```

To use `xorro` directly from source run `python -m xorro` from the project's
root directory.

# Installation

Either run `xorro` directly from source or install it by the usual means
provided by Python. We also provide anaconda packages for easy installation of
clingo:

- <https://anaconda.org/potassco/clingo>

## Warning

Currently `xorro` only works with the upcoming 5.3 version of `clingo`. So
for now the work-in-progress (wip) branch of `clingo` has to be used. If
installing with anaconda, make sure to install the development packages of
clingo.
